## Scale up description :dolphin:

This project shows a more complex structure that has a higher level of scalability with all SPOFs eliminated and GNU/Linux servershave been used to increase the efficiency of the network. The SSL certificate is not terminated at the load-balancer, hence each of the servers are protected with an intermediary firewall.

## Key issues with the infrastructure

The infrastruture would need high maintenance costs as well as cost of setup with more acquisition of servers
