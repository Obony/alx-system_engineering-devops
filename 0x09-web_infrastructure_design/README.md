# Web infrastructure design

This is a project in which we began to research web infrastructure
design. As we conducted research on different design principles, we
whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure. We started with a
simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured
system.

Files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
